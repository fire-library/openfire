Provides a method to calculate the merging flow at final
exit level, based on Figure 6 in BS 9999.

The precise equation to be used (Figure 6a, Figure 6b or Figure 6c)
depends on the
configuration of the final exit and the stair's storey exit. Note that the final
exit width should not be less than the width of the stair.
