The calculation of $W_{FE}$ varies based on the input provided to the method.
To achieve comprehensive test coverage, we need to evaluate the following conditions:

1. $N \gt 60$ & $D \lt 2$
2. $N \gt 60$ & $D \gt 2$
3. $N \lt 60$ & $D \gt 2$
4. $N \lt 60$ & $D \lt 2$

By testing all four conditions, we ensure that every possible scenario is
accounted for. If the results are correct in each case, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the method's implementation.
