The non-dimensional heat release rate $Q^*$ derived by Zukoski
uses the enclosure height as the length scale.

As described in section 2.3, small values of $Q^*$ are not thought to be
of concern for practical design purposes given that they correspond to
small temperature rises. High values of $Q^*$ correspond to greater
energy and momentum in the ceiling jet flows, corresponding to a
greater non-uniformity in the smoke layer properties.
