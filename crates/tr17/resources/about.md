The Technical Recommendation TR 17 (2013), examines the limitations of using
fire zone models for predicting smoke-filling in enclosures of varying sizes.
It provides guidance on the maximum room dimensions and other key parameters
where such models remain accurate and reliable. The document aims to ensure
the effective application of fire zone models in fire safety engineering,
helping practitioners evaluate their suitability for specific scenarios.
Published by BRANZ, it is a key reference for fire safety engineers.
