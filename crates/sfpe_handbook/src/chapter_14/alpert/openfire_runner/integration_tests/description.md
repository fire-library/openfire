The calculation of $\dot{Q}$ is the implementation of Alpert's original correlation
(equations 14.2 and 14.3 in the _SFPE Hanbook of Fire Protection Engineering_),
re-arranged to calculate the minimum (steady) HRR for activation of a heat sensor
with a known activation temperature. Two different equations can be used, depending
on whether the sensor is located in the plume impingement area (near field) or
in the ceiling jet area (far field).

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved by evaluating the two conditions covered,
namely: the near field ($\frac{r}{H} \leq 0.18$) and the far field
($\frac{r}{H} > 0.18$).

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the method's implementation.
