Equations 14.2 and 14.3 in Chapter 14 of the SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection
Engineering are correlations developed by Alpert to quantify the maximum excess
gas temperature and velocity in a ceiling jet flow produced by a steady fire.

These equations are widely used in hazard analysis and have been re-arranged to
determine the heat release rate (HRR) at which a heat sensor will activate,
based on the user-defined geometry and temperature conditions. The correlations
are derived from extensive fire test data involving various fuels, including
wood, plastics, and liquids, under a range of ceiling heights (4.6 to 18 m) and
radial positions extending to twice the ceiling height.
