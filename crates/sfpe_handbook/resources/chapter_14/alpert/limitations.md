The correlations are based on test data where the heat release rate was estimated
using measured fuel mass loss rates and estimates for the heat of combustion
from 1970â€“1971. However, these tests did not directly account for the convective
component of the heat release rate, which is more closely related to buoyancy.

For liquid alcohol pool fires (used by Alpert to develop these correlations),
the convective heat release rate is approximately 74% of the total heat release
rate, while for solid commodities like wood and mixed plastic/cardboard, it
varies from 60% to 70%. Flammable liquids like heptane fall in the middle of
this range. As a result, for general commodities, using ceiling jet correlations
that explicitly account for the convective heat release rate would enhance
accuracy. The applicability of the correlations is further limited to steady
fires, specific fuel types, and scenarios where the heat detector is fully
immersed in the ceiling jet flow.
