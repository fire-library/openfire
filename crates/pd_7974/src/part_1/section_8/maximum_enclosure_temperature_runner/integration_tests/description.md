These calculations show the implementation of the equations
derived by Thomas and Heselden and Law, to calculate the
maximum temperature in a fully developed enclosure fire
(equations 41 to 44 of _PD 7974-1_)

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved with four tests,
which explore the two sets of equations, covering the
upper bound maximum enclosure temperature (equations 41 and 42)
and the correction for a low fire load (equations 43 and 44).

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the methods' implementation.
