These calculations show the implementation of two methods for the
calculation of the HRR at flashover, one by Thomas (eq. 28) and one
by McCaffrey (eq. 29) in _PD 7974-1_.

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved with two tests, where
each test ensures the correct result for the application of each
correlation.

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the methods' implementation.
