These calculations include the maximum HRR for
a ventilation controlled-fire, based on the work by
Kawagoe (eq. 33), as well the calculation of the maximum
HRR for a fuel-controlled fire, assuming the HRRPUA and
the fire area are known (eq. 4).

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved with two tests,
one for each scenario.

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the methods' implementation.
