Equations 28 and 29 have a number of limitations that are described by
_PD 7974-1 (2019). Mainly, these relate to the data that was used to validate
these equations, which includes limited variation on the location of the fires
(all fires are assumed near the centre of the compartment), limited enclosure
sizes ($0.3$ m to $2.7$ m high and $0.14$ $m^2$ to $12$ $m^2$ floor area) and
limited opening geometries.

Additionally, _PD 7974-1 (2019)_ requires additional care for well-insulated
compartments, compartments with more than one opening, extremely fast fire.
More detail can be found in section 8.5.1.2.
