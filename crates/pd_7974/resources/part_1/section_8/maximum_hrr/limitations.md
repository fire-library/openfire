Equation 4 requires knowledge of the area of the fire as well as
the Heat Release Rate Per Unit Area (HRRPUA). Table A4 provides values
for HRRPUA for different occupancies, but the user must consider the
embedded assumptions and uncertainty in the use of this data.

Equation 33 makes a number of assumptions, including assumptions on
the heat of combustion of the fuel and the location of the neutral plane
in a compartment fire. Further information is provided in 8.5.2.2.
