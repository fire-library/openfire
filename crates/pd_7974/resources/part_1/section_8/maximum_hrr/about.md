Equation 33, based on Kawagoe's work,
calculates the maximum Heat Release Rate in a ventilation-controlled
fire.

Equation 4 calculates the Heat Release Rate for a
fuel-controlled fire for scenarios where the Heat Release
Rate Per Unit Area (HRRPUA) and the area of the fire are known,
or can be estimated.
