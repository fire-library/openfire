Flashover is a transition in compartment fires marked by rapid fire growth,
sudden temperature rise and, intense smoke production, leading to the ignition
of most combustible materials within the compartment. It is discussed by
_PD 7974-1 (2019)_ in Section 8.5.1 and it is usually characterised by a hot gas
layer temperature between $500$ 째C and $600$ 째C. Equations 28, 29 and 33 in
_PD 7974-1 (2019)_ provide different approaches to calculating the maximum HRR
in the compartment after flashover.

Equation 28, based on Thomas' analysis, estimates the heat release rate required
for flashover, assuming a 600째C temperature rise in the upper layer.
Equation 29, developed by McCaffrey et al., uses a 500째C temperature rise and
includes heat transfer through enclosure boundaries. Equation 33, based on
Kawagoe's work, calculates the heat release rate in a ventilation-controlled
fire, where the fire is limited by oxygen supply. These equations are critical
for fire behavior modeling and fire safety design.
