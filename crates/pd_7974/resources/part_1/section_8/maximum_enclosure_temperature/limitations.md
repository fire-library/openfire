The correlations provided in this section are generally applicable under the
following conditions: (a) the enclosure is of a size where flashover is likely
to occur, (b) the thermal inertia of the enclosure linings falls within the
range of $720$ $J/(m^2s^{0.5}K)$ to $2,500 J/(m²·s⁰.⁵·K)$, and (c) the value
of $\Omega$ is between $10$ $m^{-0.5}$ and $50$ $m^{-0.5}$.
