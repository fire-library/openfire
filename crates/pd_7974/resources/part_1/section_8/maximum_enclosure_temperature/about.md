Equations 41, 42, 43, and 44 in PD 7974-1 are used to estimate the maximum
enclosure temperature after flashover. Equation 41, based on Thomas, Heselden,
and Law's work, calculates the upper bound temperature $T_{g(max)}$ as a
function of ventilation parameters. Equation 42 defines the ventilation parameter
($\Omega$), which depends on the enclosure's dimensions and the heat release rate.

If the fire load is low, Equation 43 adjusts the maximum temperature estimate
to account for insufficient energy. Equation 44 evaluates the impact of fire
load on average compartment temperature. These equations are valid for specific
enclosure sizes and thermal properties.
