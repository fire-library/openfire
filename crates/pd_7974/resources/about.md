The PD 7974 suite, published by the British Standards Institution (BSI),
provides a framework for fire safety engineering design. It consists of seven
complementary documents offering guidance on various aspects of fire safety
analysis, including fire dynamics, smoke movement, structural response,
evacuation, and fire service intervention.

Developed to support BS 9999 and BS 7974, the suite uses performance-based
principles to enable tailored fire safety solutions for complex or innovative
building designs. Each document includes methodologies, design scenarios, and
calculation approaches, making the suite an indispensable resource for fire
engineers seeking compliance with UK and international fire safety regulations.
