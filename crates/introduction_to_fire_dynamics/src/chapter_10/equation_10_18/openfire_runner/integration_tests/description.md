The calculation of $F$ is the implementation of equations
10.18a and 10.18b in Introduction to Fire Dynamics.

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved by evaluating the conditions where $F$
is lower than 0.235 (ventilation-controlled fire), higher than
0.290 (fuel-controlled fire) or between 0.235 and 0.290, which identifies the transition
or "cross-over", an ill-defined condition as described by Harmathy.

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the method's implementation.
