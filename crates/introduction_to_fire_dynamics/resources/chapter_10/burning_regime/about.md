Kawagoe showed (empirically) that the burning rate depends strongly on the size and
shape of the ventilation opening for ventilation-controlled fires. For
larger openings, the burning rate is determined by the surface area and
burning characteristics of the fuel.

These equations present the derivation by Harmathy, which allow for
the identification of the burning regime inside a compartment fire and are based
on data from a large number of wood crib fires.
