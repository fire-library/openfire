The transition between ventilation controlled and fuel controlled is ill-defined,
so care should be exercised in this region. These correlations are recommended
by Harmathy for the identification of the burning regime in cellulosic fires.

Given that these equations were derived from data which used wood cribs, their
applicability to real fires is not clear, given that Harmathy's derivation
does not account for the heat feedback from the compartment boundaries. See
section 10.1 of this reference for further details.
