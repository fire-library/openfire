This equation allows for the calculation of the maximum
volumetric flow by a single exhaust vent. If multiple
vents are needed to prevent plug-holing, the method also allows
for the calculation of the minimum separation distance.
Plug-holing is the phenomenon whereby air is extracted from
below the smoke layer, which leads to a reduction in the
system's efficiency.

Note that $\gamma = 1$ for exhaust vents centred no closer
than twice the diameter from the nearest wall or,
$\gamma = 0.5$ for vents centred closer than this or located
on a wall.
