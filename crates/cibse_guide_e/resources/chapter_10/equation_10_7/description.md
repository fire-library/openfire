This equation allows for an estimation of the visibility as
a calculation of the distance at which an object
can be perceived in smoke.

This calculation depends on a visibility coefficient $K$, which
is a function of the object. For light-emitting signs $K=8$,
whereas for light-reflecting signs or building components
in reflected light, $K=3$.
