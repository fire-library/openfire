This equation allows for the calculation of the 
Fractional Effective Dose (FED), for exposure at
a constant concentration.

The FED is a comparison of the concentration
integrated over the time of exposure against $LC_{50}$,
which is the concentration that is lethal to 50% of
animal subjects for a given period of time.

An FED of $1$ is considered to be fatal, and values from 0.3
to 0.5 may represent incapacitation.
