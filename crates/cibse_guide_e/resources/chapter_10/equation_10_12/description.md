Equations 10.10 to 10.12 allow for the calculation of
the limiting average air velocity to prevent smoke spread
from the room of fire origin. The different equations
cover different configurations regarding
the relative size of the adjacent rooms as well as, the position
of the openings with regard to the smoke layer.

The calculated limiting velocity should be lower than the
average velocity, which can be calculated by dividing the extract rate
by the area of all the openings, including those which do not open
onto the communicating space. Further, an allowance should be made for
unknown leakage paths. _CIBSE Guide E_ cites a value 15% as sufficient
if the leakage paths are not known.

Equation 12 applies to fires where the smoke enters a corridor via
an open door from an adjoining room, where inlet air is provided
into the corridor to prevent smoke spread.
