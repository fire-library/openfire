Equation 12 should only be used for the specific
configuration for which it is applicable, explained
in section 10.4.2 of _CIBSE Guide E_ and summarised
in the description section above.

Equation 10.12 is not applicable for sprinkler-controlled
fires as the minimum velocity calculated would be too
small.
