Eq. 7.8 allows for the calculation of the exit capacity
of the stair, which is defined as the maximum number of people able
to enter the stair within a specified period. This is primarily limited
by the width of the final exit.

Eq. 7.8 assumes a density of people in the stairs of 3.5
m$^2$/person, which is considered a maximum density of
people without suffering extreme discomfort. _CIBSE Guide E_ does
not provide a reference for this value. Note that this
implementation of the method
automatically rounds down to the nearest integer.
