Equation 7.9 allows for an assessment of the total
number of persons that a stairway can accommodate in
a specified period of time.

This is similar to the calculation
presented in equation 7.8 of the same document (_CIBSE Guide E_)
but, using a flow of 1.2 $person/s/m$ of effective stair width (as
opposed to 1.333 $person/s/m$ in equation 7.8 of _CIBSE Guide E_) and,
an occupant density in the stair ($p$) of 2 $person/m^2$ (as opposed to
3.5 $person/m^2$ used in equation 7.8 of _CIBSE Guide E).
