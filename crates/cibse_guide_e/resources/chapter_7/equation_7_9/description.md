Equations 7.8 and 7.9 in _CIBSE Guide E_
allow for an assessment of the total
number of persons that a stairway can accommodate in
a specified period of time. While Equation 7.8
calculates the total number of persons within a specified
period without suffering extreme discomfort (using maximum values
of flow through the openings and occupant density),
this equation (7.9) calculates a lower, "acceptance"
number of persons that a stairway can accomodate,
by allowing for a lower occupant density in the stair to
be used.

The comparison in the relevant parameters (flow and occupant
density) is summarised below. This equation uses a flow of
1.2  $person/s/m$ of effective stair width (as
opposed to 1.333 $person/s/m$ in equation 7.8 of _CIBSE Guide E_) and,
an occupant density in the stair ($//rho$) of 2 $person/m^2$ (as opposed to
3.5 $person/m^2$ used in equation 7.8 of _CIBSE Guide E_). Hence, this
equation represents a more conservative approach.
