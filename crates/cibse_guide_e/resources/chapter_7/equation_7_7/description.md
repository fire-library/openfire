Eq. 7.6 allows for the calculation of the maximum
flow rate of persons through a doorway or level corridor.

_CIBSE Guide E_ notes that the use of this equation, with an
assumed notional exit time of 2.5 minutes, equation 7.6 is
equivalent to determining exit widths by assuming a capacity
of 1 person per 5 mm of exit (subject to minimum width
criteria).
