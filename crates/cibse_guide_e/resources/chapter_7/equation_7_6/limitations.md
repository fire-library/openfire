Eq. 7.6, as stated above, is built on the assumption
of a notional exit time of 2.5 minutes and, a capacity of
1 person per 5 mm of exit width.

Eq. 7.6 applies for openings and corridors of 1.1 m and
greater. Further, _CIBSE Guide E_ notes that
the user should be aware that the
flow rate through an exit may be reduced if there is downstream
congestion (considered for occupant densities which
significantly exceed 2 persons/m<sup>2</sup>).
