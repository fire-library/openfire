Eq. 6.7 presentes the simplest correlation to predict
the Heat Release Rate required for flashover, based on
the correlations described in the _SFPE Handbook of
Fire Protection Engineering_.

Eq. 6.7 relates the Heat Release Rate at flashover ($Q_f$)
with the ventilation factor ($A_{vo} \sqrt{h_o}$).
