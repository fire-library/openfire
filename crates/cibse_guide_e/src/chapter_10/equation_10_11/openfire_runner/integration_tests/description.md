The calculation of $v_e$ is the implementation of equations
10.10, 10.11 and 10.12 in _CIBSE Guide E_. This is the
implementation of equation 10.11.

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved with a single
test.

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the method's implementation.
