The calculation of $V_{max}$ is the implementation of equations
10.1 in _CIBSE Guide E_.

Comprehensive test coverage can be achieved with two sets of parameters, which
evaluate the equation for exhaust vents centred no closer than twice the diameter
from the nearest wall ($\gamma = 1$) and, the case for vents centred closer than
this or located on a wall ($\gamma = 0.5$)

If the results are correct, we can be confident in
the accuracy of the method's implementation.
