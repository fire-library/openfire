Equation 1 of _BR 187 (2014)_ calculates the ventilation factor ($O$), a
critical parameter used to evaluate the ventilation conditions of an enclosure
fire. The ventilation factor describes the influence of ventilation on fire development.
Note that the ventilation factor is defined differently in other literature
(including Drysdale's _Introduction to Fire Dynamics_
which defines it as $A \sqrt{H}$). These variations in terminology do not affect
the overall use of this term.

The ventilation factor increases with larger compartments and small
openings. For larger ventilation factors, the fire is likely to be within
the ventilation controlled regime. Drysdale's _Introduction to Fire
Dynamics_ cites a value of $O$ $<$ $8-10$ $m^{-0.5}$ as corresponding
to fuel controlled fires.
