_BR 187: External Fire Spread â€“ Building Separation and Boundary Distances_ is a
guidance document developed by the Building Research Establishment (BRE). It
provides technical recommendations for assessing and mitigating the risk of fire
spread between buildings via external walls.

The document is widely used in the UK to ensure compliance with fire safety
regulations. _BR 187 (2014)_ outlines methods to calculate boundary distances,
evaluate external fire resistance, and design buildings with adequate separation
to minimize fire hazards. It is an essential resource for fire engineers,
architects, and regulatory authorities.
