Appendix A of _BR 187_ provides the mathematical basis for evaluating
radiative heat transfer in the context of commonly used assumptions
in fire safety engineering. This includes equations to calculate incident
radiation at different distances, accounting for factors such as flame emissivity,
size, and viewing angles.

Depending on the relative distance between the source and the receiver, as
a function of the source size, then the incident radiation can be calculated as
a function of the square of the distance or, following the calculation of a
more complex configuration factor. This annex covers two geometries for the
calculation of the configuration factor: parallel source and 
receiver and, perpendicular source and receiver.
