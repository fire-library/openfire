# Equation Relationship Tracking
# 
# This file tracks relationships between equations across different documents in the OpenFire library.
# It helps identify which equations are identical or similar across different fire engineering documents.
#
# Structure:
# - identical_equations: List of lists where each inner list contains equations that are exactly the same
# - similar_equations: List of lists where each inner list contains equations that are similar but with minor variations
#
# Equation Format: "crate_name/chapter_name/equation_file_name" (without .rs extension)
# Example: "br_187/chapter_1/equation_1" or "cibse_guide_e/chapter_6/equation_6_7"
